Production Project: E-Learning Platform on AWS ECS
Objective
This project aims to use Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) to build a highly available and scalable e-learning platform. The goal is to leverage government programs to retrain graduates into IT professionals. The new platform will address current limitations and provide a robust solution to meet all student needs.

Overview
The platform was built using Terraform to ensure scalability and robustness. It integrates seamlessly with containerized applications, with all images securely stored in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

Features
Custom Networking Infrastructure:

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
ECS (Elastic Container Service)
Load Balancer
RDS (Relational Database Service)
CloudWatch for monitoring
IAM roles for security
Environment Setup:

Separate configurations for DEV, TEST, STAGING, and PROD environments
PROD environment uses port 443
Other environments use port 80
Automation:

Jenkins controller set up to automate the deployment of the infrastructure on AWS
Best Practices
Remote Backend:
Ensure the creation of a remote backend to prevent multiple engineers from using the state file simultaneously. This helps avoid infrastructure duplication or state file corruption.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Terraform installed
AWS CLI configured
Jenkins server set up (if you wish to use Jenkins for automation)


# Production Project: E-Learning Platform

## Objective
This project aims to use Amazon's Elastic Container Service (ECS) to build a highly available and scalable e-learning platform. The goal is to leverage government programs to retrain graduates into IT professionals. The new platformwill address current limitations and provide a robust solution to meet all student needs.

## Overview
The platform was built using Terraform to ensure uniformity, re-useability and robustness. It integrates seamlessly with containerized applications, with all images securely stored in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

## Features
### Infrastructure:
- **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** A VPC is used to create a secure and isolated
network for the e-learning platform.

- **ECS (Elastic Container Service):** Containers for the e-learning application
are managed and run without managing servers, using Fargate.

- **Application Load Balancer:** Incoming traffic to the e-learning platform is distributed evenly across multiple instances by the Application Load Balancer.

- **RDS (Relational Database Service):** The e-learning platform's database is managed, scaled, and operated automatically by RDS.

- **CloudWatch:** Performance metrics and logs of the e-learning application are monitored and collected by CloudWatch.

- **IAM roles:** Permissions and access to AWS resources for the e-learning project are controlled by IAM roles.

- **Route53:** The DNS management for the e-learning platform's domain is handled by Route53.

- **SSL Certificate:** Secure communication for the e-learning platform is ensured by an SSL Certificate.


### Environment Setup:
Separate environments were built for DEV, TEST, STAGING, and PROD environments.
PROD environment uses port 443.
Other environments use port 80.

## Automation:
Jenkins controller set up to automate the deployment of the infrastructure on AWS


## Best Practices
### Remote Backend:
Ensure the creation of a remote backend to prevent multiple engineers from using the state file simultaneously. This helps avoid infrastructure duplication or state file corruption.

## Prerequisites
- Terraform installed
- AWS CLI configured
- Jenkins server set up (if you wish to use Jenkins for automation)

## How to run Terraform via terminal
**To initialize, run:**
```
terraform init
```

**To plan, run:**
```
terraform plan -var-file="dev.tfvars" 
```

**To apply, run:**
```
terraform apply -var-file="dev.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

**To destroy, run:** 
```
terraform destroy -var-file="dev.tfvars" -auto-approve
```

**Note:** Specify your desired environment, be it test, staging or prod. E.g. "test.tfvars"


## How to run Jenkins
### To run the pipeline:

1. **Configure Jenkins:** Ensure Jenkins is set up with the necessary plugins (e.g., Terraform, AWS steps). Use this [link](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform) to dowload terraform onto the jenkins server.
2. **Create a Pipeline Job:** Add the pipeline script(jenkinsfile) to the Pipeline job directly or choose the SCM option. Make sure to use a choice parameter and configure it to select either "apply" or "destroy."
3. **Trigger the Build:** Start the build process to execute the defined stages.
